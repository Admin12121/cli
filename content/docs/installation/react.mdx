<Steps>

### Create project

By default, the CLI uses Vite to set up a new React application:

```bash
jhapali-ui init -n <project-name> -f react
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag for defaults i.e `zinc`.

```bash
jhapali-ui init -n <project-name> -f react -d
```

</Callout>

### Configure project 

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt showLineNumbers
Enter your project name: my-app
Choose a framework: React
Which color would you like to use as base color? neutral
```

### That's it

After configuration, the setup automatically creates a project folder with your chosen name, installs dependencies, and configures Tailwind CSS with Vite. No extra setup is neededâ€”start coding right away!

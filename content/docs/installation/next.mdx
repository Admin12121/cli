Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
jhapali-ui init -n <project-name> -f next
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag for defaults i.e `src/` directory, `app-router` and `zinc`.

```bash
jhapali-ui init -n <project-name> -f next -d
```

</Callout>

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt showLineNumbers
Enter your project name: my-app
Choose a framework: Next.js
Would you like your code inside a src/ directory? yes

```
